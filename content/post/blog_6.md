### What did you do this past week?

I finished the project with my team. The main task I completed last week was the dynamic GitLab stats on the about page as well as some miscellaneous UI work.

### What's in your way?

The midterm grind has paused for a bit, so I think I'll just be working on ramping up Phase II and starting recently assigned projects and homework for other classes.

### What will you do next week?

Phase II seems to be much larger than Phase I, so I will probably start working on that early next week.

### If you read it, what did you think of Why Is Silicon Valley So Awful to Women?

I feel like these kinds of sexist actions are likely encouraged by a company's culture and that companies that have a culture that tolerates them should be called out.

### What was your experience of iterators, reduce(), and tuple?

I had no idea that `iter(iter(a))` was the same as `iter(a)` and that `iter(...)` of an iterator is just a copy of itself. It's weird but it does kind of make sense. `reduce()` is interesting as such a simple function can represent so many different operations. I recently learned about [MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) which takes it to a new level. Tuple is odd because it has pretty much a subset of the features of a list with the same complexities. In practice, one could just always use a list and get away with it most of the time, although tuple's immutability and hash-ability do give it some extra functionality.

### What's it like working in a group?

In my experience, there are groups that make things take longer (compared to doing a task solo) and groups that make it considerably faster. Fortunately, my project group is the latter.

### What was your experience of the team contract?

I think it was good to set expectations and was easy to work through with my team but I'm not sure the contract would have helped a team that was already dysfunctional.

### What was your experience of the peer review?

My team was great to work with and made the peer review easy to fill out.

### What made you happy this week?

I had time to integrate the [Google Smart Home API](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome) into my custom home automation server and so I can now control everything directly from my lock screen or with Google Assistant. It saves only about a second off of doing things like turning off the lights, but it looks super cool.

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Since we're using SQL in Phase II of the project, my pick-of-the-week is [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/). It's a dashboard and editor that turns your database into basically an editable spreadsheet. It's been super helpful for tweaking and debugging databases in previous projects.

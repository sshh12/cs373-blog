### Where did you grow up?

I was born in Houston and lived there (for the most part in Cypress) until I came UT. 

### What high school did you attend?

I went to [Cy-Ranch High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypress_Ranch_High_School).

### What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?

Band and Computer Science Club. I learned a ton, met a lot of cool people, and really enjoyed it.

### Why did you come to UT?

It has a well known CS program and I had several friends from my high school who were going there as well.

### Why are you majoring in CS?

I grew up writing code and it's just something I really enjoy doing.

### Why are you in this class?

It teaches practical/industry skills and has a writing flag.

### How much Javascript/Python/Web programming do you already know?

I've probably written `>100k` lines of code in each of these.

### How did you like the two lectures?

Prof. Downing seems to have adapted his teaching style really well to online learning. I really like the type-in-notepad lecture style as it's easy to read, take notes, and has comfortable pacing.

### How did you feel about the cold calling?

It's definitely anxiety inducing and I personally don't feel like I've done better in classes that have use it.

### What did you do this past week?

I finished the project! I spent quite a while on just reading the workflow over and over again to make sure I got everything but now it's very satisfying to finally be done. I also attempted some more interesting optimizations to see if I could make it run even faster (for example: hardcoding a [base65536](https://github.com/Parkayun/base65536) encoded [gzip](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html)'d and [struct](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html)-packed table for all 1M values) but I ended up just submitting the simplest version that passed the HackerRank.

### What's in your way?

Nothing, I'm done ðŸŽ‰.

### What will you do next week?

Likely work on projects and homework that I just got assigned for other classes. I'm still new to GitLab so I might explore some of it features more and see if it's worth using it with/instead of GitHub.

### What was your experience of Collatz, the starter code, the makefile, its optimizations, and exceptions?

It definitely felt like the project setup was a bit overkill for the size of the problem but I guess it's better to learn these tools with an easy problem than to have to both solve a complex problem and learn the tools at the same time. I thought the starter code was well organized and intuitive enough that I didn't feel like I had to make any big changes to the existing code to solve the problem of how I wanted to. It's a bit annoying that `make` isn't very well supported on Windows but using it through WSL isn't too bad. Exceptions make sense so far and I thought the in-class use-exceptions-without-exceptions exercise was pretty interesting.

### What made you happy this week?

I way overestimated the amount of work I had to do last week and had a lot of extra time to [relax](https://www.netflix.com/).

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

A friend of mine recently showed me this [vscode-pull-request-github](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github) plugin for GitHub that allows you to manage PR's directly from vscode. The extension allows you to review, create, edit, and organize all your pull requests for the project you're currently working on.

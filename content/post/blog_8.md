### What did you do this past week?

I completed midterms for this and other classes. I also finished more of my tasks for the project including setting up our database, messing with UML, and creating the groundwork for the UI tests.

### What's in your way?

Nothing for now, but soon assignments and projects that will inevitably be assigned by other classes.

### What will you do next week?

I will finish the few remaining phase 2 parts of the project and begin planning with my group what we will do for phase 3.

### If you read it, what did you think of The Liskov Substitution Principle?

I would say it makes sense and I agree. They did a great job of explaining how it works for common use cases and how it would apply for tricky edge-case abstractions. They also made it very clear how not following the principle can easily result in some bad anti-patterns.

### What was your experience with Test #1?

I would rate it a `5/5` midterm experience. It was a good amount of time, based directly on the content we learned in class without being a copy/paste-from-slides thing, allowed for additional resources, in an applied/coding/test-case/multi-attempt format, and had an interesting collaborative component. Would take it again.

### What made you happy this week?

With the exception of writing this blog post, I did absolutely zero work this weekend (everything that needs to be done in the near future is already done) and it has felt great, especially after 2 weeks of grind. I also voted the week and was legitimately happy to see/stand in a long line of other students voting at the FAC. Also, the weather has been great recently.

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

For those who haven't heard or tried yet, [GoLang](https://golang.org/) is a very cool language to learn and use. Its syntax is almost as easy and quick to write as Python, just the right amount of typing, it's nearly as fast as C, and it outputs a single concise executable. I recently re-wrote some performance-sensitive projects from Python into Go and it's made me a Go fanboy.

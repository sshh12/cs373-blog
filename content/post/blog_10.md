### What did you do this past week?

I finished planning phase III with my team and started working on my tasks. I didn't do to much SWE work so will have to catch up a bit.

### What's in your way?

The rest of this project, midterms, other projects, and a 2-day road trip this week.

### What will you do next week?

Finish phase III soon, which on my end means implementing the two user stories and some cleanup.

### If you read it, what did you think of The Interface Segregation Principle?

It seemed very similar to the previous reading by this author. I think it's amazing how these code-pattern problems are still so relevant today. I wish it was a written using examples from a language like Python or Javascript since patterns can change across languages and I don't write that much `C++` but for the most part the ideas in the paper were language agnostic.

### What was your experience of instance methods, class methods, static methods, regular expressions, and relational algebra?

Instance, class, static are a great way to group methods relevant to a class, although I've often seen static methods abused and used when a normal function would have been clearer. I also think it's cool that the Python syntax supports instance methods being used on the classes themselves with an explicitly passed `self`. This makes it much easier to use functional patterns like `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, etc. with objects without the need for an additional lambda expression.

I think there are two types of people, those who really like regex and those who hate it. I'm the former and probably use it [more than I should](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags). It's a super-powerful syntax for doing very intricate string pattern matching and saves writing a ton of extra code for many use cases, although [they don't always work well everywhere](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage/).

I'm a bit familiar with relational algebra from SQL, but don't have much previous experience with it.

### What made you happy this week?

I'm about to head back to my parents' house in Indiana (think: cabin in the middle of the woods disconnected from the world vibe) for the rest of the semester. Even though I'll still be working from there, it's enough of a vacation to be pretty hyped about.

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Along the lines of our weekly readings for SWE, I read [Out of the Tar Pit](http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf) this week. It's a fairly long paper on the causes of software complexity, why and how state can be misused, and how to write understandable large-scale software systems.
